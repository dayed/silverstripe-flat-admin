# silverstripe-flat-admin
####Custom CSS for the SilverStripe CMS Admin Interface.

This module basic overrides some basic CSS that is found in the SilverStripe framework.

###TODO:
- customise GridField to suit the new colors .e.g. remove texture
- change icons in menu to be white
- change icons used in buttons, something a bit more moder and no drop shadow will be nice.
- remove any textures and dropwshadows in other parts of the interface.
